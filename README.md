# Ademir
Ademir is a bot designed to simulate administration behavior in CTF XSS challenges.

It opens webpages using a chrome web driver and renders any javascript in it.

There are two operation modes:

* env `USEWEBHOOK=true`
    In this operation mode, Ademir setup's a webhook at `http://localhost/ademir/dashboard` where it navigate into each url it receives via `address POST par√¢meter`.
* env `USEWEBHOOK=false`
    In this operation mode, just run it as `./ademir url`, it will open your url and end its execution.

`.env` example:

```
PORT=80
FLAG="CTF-BR{BelevieThisIsTheRealFlag}"
INSTANCES=10
USEWEBHOOK=true
DEBUG=true
```

# Running it
`docker build -t ademir .`

`docker run -it ademir`

# TODO
- [ ] task 1: Improve cookies management
- [ ] task 2: Code Refactoring
- [ ] task 3: Cooldown and token access
- [ ] task 4: SSRF Prevention

## Improve Cookies management
To navigate to the hooked page with cookies defined, currently, the bot first has to open the hostname page, set cookies and then navigate into the hooked page with cookies already set

At the end of this task, it won't be necessary to navigate any page before set cookies
## Code Refactoring
This version is still with many problems, so it's essential to refactor its code and turn it mo clear and concise

At the end of this task, the code must be more readable
## Cooldown and Token access
Adding cooldown and token restrictions will make this bot more safe from attacks even though it should never be exposed to internet

At the end of this task, the bot will prevent DoS and other issues
## SSRF Prevention
Another important thing to improve it's security is preventing SSRF

At the end of this task, the bot will be saffer
